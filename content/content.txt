The Elements of Typographic Style
by Robert Bringhurst

Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of
The Elements of Typographic Stylecovers
Choosing and Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces
that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final screen
conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the
subject." He tells us to "start with a single typographic family," but
when the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the type optically more
than mathematically."

I Love Typography
by John Boardley

From the website: I love Typography (ILT)
was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for
typography, type design, and lettering, and for the words born of
those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to
draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had
an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the subject more
accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses, if you
will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world without type, but
at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for granted.
So take a closer look." ilovetypography.com

Love and Joy About Letters
by Ben Shahn

Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
lithographer. In
Love and Joy About Letters he writes: "I
discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are
quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and the hand
can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet
sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are
the balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter
of skill and feeling and art."
