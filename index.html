          <h3>The Elements of Typographic Style</h3>
          by Robert Bringhurst
          
          Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of
          The Elements of Typographic Stylecovers
          Choosing and Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces
          that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final screen
          conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the
          subject." He tells us to "start with a single typographic family," but
          when the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the type optically more
          than mathematically."</p>

          the site Brown writes, "You may have noticed, there are lots of
          typefaces out there to choose among. Here you'll find the ones I
          prefer, and my reasons."

        <h3>The Elements of Typographic Style</h3>
        by Robert Bringhurst
        <p>While not a typographer himself, Bringhurst is a poet, with a love for

        <h3>I Love Typography</h3>
        by John Boardley
        <p>From the website: I love Typography (ILT)
          was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for
          typography, type design, and lettering, and for the words born of
          those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to
          draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had
          an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the subject more
          accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses, if you
          will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world without type, but
          at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for granted.

        <h3>Love and Joy About Letters</h3>
        by Ben Shahn
        <p>Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
          often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
          lithographer. In
          Love and Joy About Letters he writes: "I
          discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
          dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are
          quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and the hand
          can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet
          sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are
          the balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter
          of skill and feeling and art."</p>
